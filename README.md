# EntityMatching
In this project, Zo√© Goey & Lane endeavor to compare the Python Record Linkage Toolkit (PRLT) to Deepmatcher for entity matching. We use the FEBR1 dataset that comes with the PRLT, which includes 1000 rows consisting of 500 matches (each row has exactly one match). This project was done in Google Colab and targets clients who wish to develop an entity matching algorithm for a new product. The PRLT achieved F1 score, Precision, and Recall of 100% using the Naive Bayes classifier and Deepmatcher achieved an F1 score of 93.33%, Precision of 100% and Recall of 87.5%.
