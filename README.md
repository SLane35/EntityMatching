# EntityMatching
In this project, Zo√© Goey & Lane endeavor to compare the Python Record Linkage Toolkit (PRLT) to Deepmatcher for entity matching. We use the FEBR1 dataset that comes with the PRLT, which includes 1000 rows consisting of 500 matches (each row has exactly one match). This project was done in Google Colab and targets data scientists who are working on entity matching.
